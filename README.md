# Deep Core: An X-Wing Miniatures tool

## About

This started as a pet project in order for me to learn more about the available pilots, ships, upgrades, etc for [X-wing Miniatures](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/). If other people end up finding it useful too then that's great! :smiley:

## Deep Core?

According to Star Wars Canon, [The Deep Core](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Deep_Core) is the heart of the galaxy and home to the Wellspring of Life, the birthplace of the midichlorians. I thought this was appropriate given my [lofty goals](#goals). Also, it sounds pretty cool!

## Goals

I have lofty goals

- [ ] Collection manager
- [ ] Squad builder
- [ ] Squad browser
- [ ] Squad rankings
- [ ] Purchase advisor
- [ ] Maneuver simulator ( I like practising flying my ships [with sounds!] :stuck_out_tongue: )

## There are other tools already!

Yep. And they work just fine. I'm a developer by trade and hobby, I prefer to build my own stuff. It's nothing against those other tools, I just like mine better. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The other tools I've seen out there are using techniques and technology that is dated. I'm building this application with a more modern toolset.

- React
- Redux
- Material Design
