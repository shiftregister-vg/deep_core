# Modern X-Wing Squad Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevegood/mxwsb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevegood/mxwsb)

## About

This started as a pet project in order for me to learn more about the available pilots, ships, upgrades, etc for [X-wing Miniatures](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/). If other people end up finding it useful too then that's great! :smiley:

## Goals

I have lofty goals

- [ ] Collection manager
- [ ] Squad builder
- [ ] Squad browser
- [ ] Squad rankings
- [ ] Purchase advisor
- [ ] Maneuver simulator ( I like practising flying my ships [with sounds!] :stuck_out_tongue: )

## Why 'Modern'?

The other tools I've seen out there are using techniques and technology that is dated. I'm building this application with a more modern toolset.

- React
- Redux
- Material Design

## There are other tools already!

Yep. And they work just fine. I'm a developer by trade and hobby, I prefer to build my own stuff. It's nothing against those other tools, I just like mine better. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
